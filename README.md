# Genetic-Experiment

A program exploring basic capabilities of genetic algorithms as a means of simulating intelligence behavior. 

Function: 
read m1.txt into a maze
place population
apply genetic algorithm to help popualation reach goal
record and output some basic performance information to console

The source code here is set to always intake a m1.txt as the maze to use. If you want to make a new one, go ahead, using
the same structure as m1.txt.
